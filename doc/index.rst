Unified Tidal Analysis and Prediction in Python
======================================================

The `reference implementation`_ of UTide was written in
Matlab.  The algorithms and original implementation are
extensively documented by Codiga (2011) [codiga2011]_.  Here we
describe a Python implementation presently under
development.

# Unified Tidal Analysis and Prediction in Python

The [`reference implementation`](https://www.po.gso.uri.edu/~codiga/utide/utide.htm) of UTide was written in
Matlab.  The algorithms and original implementation are
extensively documented by [Codiga (2011)](ftp://www.po.gso.uri.edu/pub/downloads/codiga/pubs/2011Codiga-UTide-Report.pdf).  Here we
describe a Python implementation presently under
development.
